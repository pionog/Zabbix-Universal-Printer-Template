## Overview

My attempt to make a universal printer template in Zabbix 6.4.

It works fine on Konica Minolta and HP color printers (at least they seem to work for me).

### Following components:

- Color toners
- Total number of printed pages
- Printer model
- Color mode (CMYK, KCMY, YMCK)

## Todo

Make black and white printers work fine as the color ones.
